# QuadGUITry
Some experiments

What must be done

Generally: 
I must create not too ugly GUI that will create the interface for the QUAD user.

Specs: 
1. The code must be as suitable for raspberry pi 4 executable file. (.exe) 
2. The main window must contain the camera picture.
3. Optional, if possible: on the main window must be the the ledlight representing states of the QUAD:
    a. Green: Ready
    b. Yellow: QR search
    c. Red: Executing 
4. Dialog window
